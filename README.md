# Stock Price Checker

This is the boilerplate for the Stock Price Checker project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-projects/stock-price-checker
Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://stock-price-checker.freecodecamp.rocks/.

Since all reliable stock price APIs require an API key, we've built a workaround. Use https://stock-price-checker-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/ to get up-to-date stock price information without needing to sign up for your own key.

Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

Clone this GitHub repo and complete your project locally.
Use our Replit starter project to complete your project.
Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.
If you use Replit, follow these steps to set up the project:

Start by importing the project on Replit.
Next, you will see a .replit window.
Select Use run command and click the Done button.
When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.

SET NODE_ENV to test without quotes and set DB to your MongoDB connection string
Complete the project in routes/api.js or by creating a handler/controller
You will add any security features to server.js
You will create all of the functional tests in tests/2_functional-tests.js
Note Privacy Considerations: Due to the requirement that only 1 like per IP should be accepted, you will have to save IP addresses. It is important to remain compliant with data privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation. One option is to get permission to save the user's data, but it is much simpler to anonymize it. For this challenge, remember to anonymize IP addresses before saving them to the database. If you need ideas on how to do this, you may choose to hash the data, truncate it, or set part of the IP address to 0.

Write the following tests in tests/2_functional-tests.js:

Viewing one stock: GET request to /api/stock-prices/
Viewing one stock and liking it: GET request to /api/stock-prices/
Viewing the same stock and liking it again: GET request to /api/stock-prices/
Viewing two stocks: GET request to /api/stock-prices/
Viewing two stocks and liking them: GET request to /api/stock-prices/
